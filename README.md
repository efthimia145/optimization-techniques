# optimization-techniques
This repository contains some projects realised for the "Optimization Techniques" course, during the 7th semester of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Undergraduate program. 

## Project-1

**Minimization of a convex function  without restrictions [Pt. 1]**
Implementation of minimization algorithms for a given convex function using the below methods:
- Bisectrix
- Golden Section
- Fibonacci 
- Bisectrix Method using derivatives

## Project-2

**Minimization of a convex function  without restrictions [Pt. 2]**
Implementation of minimization algorithms for a given convex function using the below methods:
- Steepest Descent
- Newton
- Levenberg-Marquardt

## Project-3

**Minimization of a convex function  with restrictions**
Implementation of the Steepest Descent with Projection method for a given function.

## Project

**Implementation of a genetic algorithm**
A genetic algorithm is implemented aiming at the approximation of a function f as a sum of Gaussians.
